This text appears on a Batman show but we suspect that it is actually code.
It's your job to find out what it says! (The flag is in uppercase)

File reads:
NAANAAANNNAANAAAANANANANAAAAAAAANNAANAAANAAANANNAAAAAAAANNNAANAAAAANAANAAAA

There are only 2 characters, and the file command shows that the file is ASCII text.
Maybe binary substitution will work.

NAANAAANNNAANAAAANANANANAAAAAAAANNAANAAANAAANANNAAAAAAAANNNAANAAAAANAANAAAA

Nada, not divisible by 8.

How many different characters are there? If there are only 2 different symbols, it is likely the cipher is Baconian

http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/baconian-cipher/
A sequence of 5 characters... let's break up the text string

From the cypher from the link above, assume N = B, A = A
NAANA AANNN AANAA AANAN ANANA AAAAA AANNA ANAAA NAAAN ANNAA AAAAA ANNNA ANAAA AANAA NAAAA
t     h     e     f     l     a     g     (i)/j   s   n     a     p     i/j   e     r

the flag is napier

Remember the flag is uppercase...
