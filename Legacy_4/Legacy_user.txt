This is an old XP machine, hence 'Legacy'.
Using an nmap vuln scan shows the machine is vulnerable to MS08-067.
A metasploit module grants access to user and root.

# The nmap vuln script showed that Legacy may be vulnerable to EternalBlue.
After launching a metasploit module and pointing RHOSTS to 10.10.10.4,
the exploit was unable to crack into the box.
However, nmap can be further utilized to scan the box for smb vulns

ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep vuln | grep smb
nmap --script smb-vuln* 10.10.10.4

mb-vuln-ms08-067:

This grants a shell, but it currently is laggy and times out.

We also have access to root!

Looking through nmap script files:
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep vuln | grep smb

nmap --script smb-vuln* 10.10.10.4
