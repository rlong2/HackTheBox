Another Github exploit, an improved version of the above link

#########
# TL,DR #
#########
Anonymous FTP access gives direct access to Users folder for user.txt

########
# Hack #
########
nmap shows http, ftp, msrpc, netbios-ssn, microsoft-ds, and unknown
There is anonymous ftp access!
ftp 10.10.10.152
cd Users
get users.txt
dd58ce67b49e15105e88096c8d9255a5

Now time for root. Port 80 shows PRTG network monitor.
Gobuster is returning an error: Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers.

PRTG's default creds are prtgadmin:prtgadmin but that comes back as invalid.
A reset password link says an email is sent when user prtgadmin is entered.

Hmm. Let's poke around in the ftp server and see if there are any clues.
According to the link in sources, PRTG stores it's data in a few locations. 
Program Files\PRTG Network Monitor
Program Files(x86)\PRTG Network Monitor
Programdata\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor

ftp://10.10.10.152/../../Windows/PRTG Configuration.dat exists, but I can't make anything of it.

dir -al shows hidden files.
/Programdata/Paessler/PRTG Network Monitor has interesting data!
I dumped interesting data into my local FTP_Files/ directory.

Searching through PRTG\ Configuration.old.bak gives login credentials:
   <dbpassword>
          <!-- User: prtgadmin -->
          PrTg@dmin2018

prtgadmin:PrTg@dmin2018

Login still says invalid credentials...
PrTg@dmin2019
PrTg@dmin2020
PrTg@dmin2021
 
I reset the machine and prtgadmin:PrTg@dmin2019 granted access!

A support ticket reads:
Version 18.4.47.1962 has been downloaded and is ready for installation. 
So this PRTG version must be < 18.4.47.1962 
Found: 
Installed Version
18.1.37.13946 


searchsploit shows some interesting things for prtg

Reset the HTB machine if obvious credentials are not working!

searchsploit -p foobar 
copies the directory of foobar's exploit
searchsploit -p prtg 18.2 copied /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/remote/18.sh to clipboard

I couldn't get this to work so I'll keeep looking.
There's an interesting github repo with an exploit. 
It calls for intercepting a valid login cookie with burp.

Cookie	OCTOPUS1813713946	e0Y0QkM3NERELTlGQkUtNDAxNS05M0QxLTFDOUIyMkUxQzQwMn0%3D

I ran the script and got output
 [*] exploit completed new user 'pentest' with password 'P3nT3st!' created have fun! 

New credentials still give invalid login.

Trying another github repo...
