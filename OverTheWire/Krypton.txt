Level 0 -> Level 1

Welcome to Krypton! The first level is easy. The following string encodes the password using Base64:

S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=

Use this password to log in to krypton.labs.overthewire.org with username krypton1 using SSH on port 2222. You can find the files for other levels in /krypton/

Solution: Decode the base64 string

KRYPTONISGREAT

Using username "krypton1".

Welcome to Krypton!

This game is intended to give hands on experience with cryptography
and cryptanalysis.  The levels progress from classic ciphers, to modern,
easy to harder.

Although there are excellent public tools, like cryptool,to perform
the simple analysis, we strongly encourage you to try and do these
without them for now.  We will use them in later excercises.

** Please try these levels without cryptool first **


The first level is easy.  The password for level 2 is in the file
'krypton2'.  It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13.
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.  When using alpha characters for
cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters,
regardless of word boundaries.  This helps obfuscate any patterns.

This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to
the cipher text.

Enjoy!

Level 2 -> Level 3
ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher.

Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm. In this example of a substitution cipher, we will explore a ‘monoalphebetic’ cipher. Monoalphebetic means, literally, “one alphabet” and you will see why.

This level contains an old form of cipher called a ‘Caesar Cipher’. A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number. For example:

plain:  a b c d e f g h i j k ...
cipher: G H I J K L M N O P Q ...

In this example, the letter ‘a’ in plaintext is replaced by a ‘G’ in the ciphertext so, for example, the plaintext ‘bad’ becomes ‘HGJ’ in ciphertext.

The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3. It is in 5 letter group ciphertext. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher. Without any further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break. You do not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key. If you think logically, this is completely easy.

One shot can solve it!

Have fun.

Additional Information:

The encrypt binary will look for the keyfile in your current working directory. Therefore, it might be best to create a working direcory in /tmp and in there a link to the keyfile. As the encrypt binary runs setuid krypton3, you also need to give krypton3 access to your working directory.

Here is an example:

krypton2@melinda:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ
krypton2@melinda:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ
krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat
krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ls
keyfile.dat
krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ chmod 777 .
krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ /krypton/krypton2/encrypt /etc/issue
krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ls
ciphertext  keyfile.dat
