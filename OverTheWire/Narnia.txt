Narnia

Description:
This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most
common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the
source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it. The
difficulty of the game is somewhere between Leviathan and Behemoth, but some of the
levels could be quite tricky.

Narnia’s levels are called narnia0, narnia1, … etc. and can be accessed on narnia.labs.overthewire.org through SSH on port 2226.

To login to the first level use:

Username: narnia0
Password: narnia0

Data for the levels can be found in /narnia/.

given:
ssh narnia0@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226

Source code reads:
int main(){
    long val=0x41414141;
    char buf[20];

    printf("Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!\n");
    printf("Here is your chance: ");
    scanf("%24s",&buf);

    printf("buf: %s\n",buf);
    printf("val: 0x%08x\n",val);

    if(val==0xdeadbeef){
        setreuid(geteuid(),geteuid());
        system("/bin/sh");
    }
    else {
        printf("WAY OFF!!!!\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}

buf is an array of chars that can hold 20 bytes
The user input for buf allows 24 chars.

The order that variables are declared in dictates where they are on the stack.

char buf[20] (20 bytes) is declared second.
val (8 bytes) is declared first, it is on the bottom. 

The user input can take 24 bytes.
