# A collection of walkthroughs for CTF-style challenges

## https://hackthebox.eu
The goal of HackTheBox is to hack into intentionally insecure 
computers given an IP address and retrieve user.txt and root.txt flags. 

Directory naming sturcture correspends to the box name and IP address.
For example, Luke_117 means the box named Luke is at 10.10.10.117.
All files generated during the hack will be in the corresponding directories.

In each directory, Boxname_user.txt will contain the walkthrough.
Each Boxname_user.txt file has:
	Sources and Links        *Helpful links*
	TL;DR                    *Short synopsis of the hack* 
	Hack                     *More in-depth explanation of the hack*
	Learned				   *Important things I want to remember*
