This is a collection of my walkthroughs through various challengles
from hackthebox.eu and overthewire.org. The goal of hackthebox is to hack into intentionally insecure 
computers given an IP address and retrieve user.txt and root.txt flags. The goal of overthewire varies, 
but is centered around linux servers, ssh, web security, cryptography, etc.

For hackthebox:
Any sources I use for help  are provided in the corresponding folder.
Directory naming sturcture correspends to the box name and IP address.
For example, luke_117 means the box named Luke is at 10.10.10.117.
All files generated during the hack will be in the corresponding directories.

In each directory, boxname_user.txt will contain the walkthrough.
If root.txt requires lots of steps, a seperate boxname_root.txt
will be included.
